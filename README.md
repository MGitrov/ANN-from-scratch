# Introduction
Although I have already created two projects dealing with neural networks, I felt that I do not fully understand the “under the hood” of neural networks, so the process of parsing thoroughly each line of implementation from scratch code might be helpful.

I have used [Victor Zhou’s implementation code](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/), and besides that, I have also created a PDF file where I thoroughly tried to explain the theory behind the neural network, along with the parsing of each line of the implementation code.

It is recommended to follow the implementation code along with the PDF file.
